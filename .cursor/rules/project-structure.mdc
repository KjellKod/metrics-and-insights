# Engineering Metrics and Insights Project Structure

Review workflow and expectations:
- [AGENTS.md](mdc:AGENTS.md)
- [CODE-REVIEW.md](mdc:CODE-REVIEW.md)

This repository contains scripts for gathering and analyzing engineering metrics from Jira and GitHub to help engineering teams identify process improvement areas.

## Core Architecture

The project is organized into two main modules:

### Git Metrics Module ([git_metrics/](mdc:git_metrics/))
- **Primary Script**: [developer_activity_insight.py](mdc:git_metrics/developer_activity_insight.py) - Comprehensive PR metrics and developer activity analysis
- **Supporting Scripts**: Analysis tools for releases, CI performance, code review patterns, and repository activity
- **Documentation**: [git_metrics/README.md](mdc:git_metrics/README.md) contains detailed usage for all Git metrics scripts

### Jira Metrics Module ([jira_metrics/](mdc:jira_metrics/))
- **Utilities**: [jira_utils.py](mdc:jira_metrics/jira_utils.py) - Shared utilities for JIRA API interactions, authentication, and common patterns
- **Core Scripts**: Individual contributor analysis, cycle time tracking, engineering excellence metrics, and release failure analysis
- **Tests**: Located in [jira_metrics/tests/](mdc:jira_metrics/tests/) with comprehensive unit test coverage

## Key Configuration Files

- [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) - Python dependencies
- [pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml) - Black code formatter configuration (line-length = 120)
- `.env` file - Environment variables for GitHub and Jira API credentials (not tracked in git)

## Entry Points and Usage Patterns

All scripts follow a consistent pattern:
1. Load environment variables using `python-dotenv`
2. Parse command-line arguments with `argparse`
3. Support `-verbose` and `-csv` flags for output control
4. Include comprehensive error handling and validation
5. Generate CSV exports for data visualization and sharing

Scripts should be run from the project root directory using module notation (e.g., `python3 git_metrics/developer_activity_insight.py`).
